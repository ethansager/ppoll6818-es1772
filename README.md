# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @ethansager, a master's student at McCourt School of Public Policy in International Development Policy 
- 👀 I’m interested in social impact, econometrics, beneficiary dignity, and evaluations
- 🌱 I previously worked for Gallup as a Survey Research Consultant and the Ross Center for Sustainable Cities as a MEL assistant.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on novel methods for development evaluations or cool ways to track impact!
